        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p class="tentangku">Hi there, my name is Maxwell and I’m from Indonesia, I’m here to share my experience and my knowledge about my pets. Well I have taken care of a lot of pets like fish, dogs, pygmy hedgehog etc. But here, I’ll only share a few tips for pets that maybe can help you understand about them.
        </p>
        <h1 id=guguk class="guguk">Dogs</h1><img class="b" src="cherry.jpg">
        <p class="anjing">Let’s start with one of the most favorite pets in the world and I currently have 6 dogs in total. They are very cute and energetic but some of them are very lazy. I have beagle, Golden Retriever, Pomeranian, Maltese, and other types of crossbreed dogs. Just like humans, they also have their own personality. It's quite easy to take a good care of them but it’s also challenging at the same time. So here’s the info that you may need:
            <li>Exercise: You should take your dog for a walk or play with your dog so your dog is healthy and more energetic.</li>
            <li>Food: you can give them dog food or other food but try to avoid giving chocolate because it can poison your dog.</li>
            <li>Diseases: The most common disease that my dog often experienced is flea. This can happen if your neighbor dogs have fleas or while you are taking your dog for a walk. Don’t worry, getting rid of the fleas is easy. All you need to do is buy some anti flea shampoo or buy some internal medicine for your dog like Bravecto.
            </li></p>
        <h1 id=cupang>Betta Fish</h1><img class="c" src="cupang.jpg">
        <p class="cupang">In my opinion, Betta Fish is one of the easiest fish that you can possibly adopt as a pet. Betta fish can be classified as a strong animal type and it’s very easy to take care of . This is a very beautiful fish. They have so many types of colors and they also have their own types, such as: Crown tail, Big ear/Dumbo, half moon, veil tail, etc. You can spot the difference from their tail. But keep it in mind that it’s a very aggressive fish compared to the other type of fish that you probably may know. Here’s more about betta fish:</p>
            <li>Food/diet: you can use regular fish food but you can also give them a blood worm (they are very like it).</li>
            <li>Tank mates: avoid any other betta or small fish and make sure you have a big tank/aquarium if you want to make a community tank with this fish.</li>
        <h1 id=hedgehog class="landak">Pygmy Hedgehog</h1><img class="d" src="landak.jpg">
         <p class="hedgehog">This little fella is very adorable looking but be careful with the spines. Don't worry the spines aren't easily detached from their body. For me to take care for this animals is quite challenging because there are several things that you must know, like:
                <li>Decorations: you should give it a hiding spot because this animal loves to hide, make sure the cage/place is not too small for your hedgehog. </li>
                <li>Food/diet: you can give him cat food and sometimes you can feed him mealworms</li>
                <li>Exercise: make sure you give your hedgehog attention and play with him, it also loves to round around in the house but sometimes it can be so lazy. </li>
        <h1 id= tokek class= "tokek">Leopard Gecko</h1><img class="g" src="tokek.jpg">
        <p class= "gecko">I bought my geckos in the animal exhibition, they are all sunglow leopard geckos. There are so many types of gecko that you can choose. Keep this in mind that this type of gecko could grow their tails again but it won't be as good as they once were.
            <li>Diet: cricket & mealworm</li>
            <li>Decorations: they must have a hiding spot.</li>
        <h1 id= salamander class= "salamander">Salamander</h1><img class="s" src="salamander.jpg">
        <p class= "salamanderc">I just bought this pet this year in a fish shop near my house. I bought a red belly salamander which is a full aquatic salamander but sometimes it would climb and stay in the rock for several minutes, i.e 1-3 minute. The size of this animal isn't too big, it can grow up to 7-10 centimeter.
            <li>Diet: frozen or life bloodworms.</li>
            <li>Decoration: You would need to provide hiding spots and rocks/wood because sometimes it loves to chill above the water.</li>
            <p class= "sry">*P.s so sorry if there are some mistakes or not accurate information.
